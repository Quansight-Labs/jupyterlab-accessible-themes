## Font

This theme is using the [Atkinson Hyperlegible font](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont), which focuses on letterform distinction to increase character recognition, ultimately improving readability.

This font can only be changed for the `Markdown viewer` and the `Terminal`. You will need to make these changes from the `Advanced settings` editor in the JupyterLab UI:

1. Select the `Settings` option in the `menu bar`.
2. Go to `Markdown viewer settings`, and type the font family that you want to use.
3. To change the `Terminal` font, scroll down to `Terminal settings` and type the name of the font family.
