This repository defines a set of accessible themes according to [WCAG color standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html). Please note that some themes are optimized for colorblindness and/or high contrast. Inside the README of each theme, you will find detailed information about the colors, their purpose and reference links from the original authors.

## About the themes

- [Pitaya Smoothie](./packages/pitayasmoothie/README.md) - Color-blind friendly
- [GitHub Light](./packages/githublight/README.md)
- [Github Dark](./packages/githubdark/README.md)

## Font

=======

All the themes are using the [Atkinson Hyperlegible font](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont), which focuses on letter form distinction to increase character recognition, ultimately improving readability.

This font can only be changed for the `Markdown viewer` and the `Terminal`. You will need to make these changes from the `Advanced settings` editor in the JupyterLab UI:

1. Select the `Settings` option in the `menu bar`.
2. Go to `Markdown viewer settings`, and type the font family that you want to use.
3. To change the `Terminal` font, scroll down to `Terminal settings` and type the name of the font family.

## Requirements üì¶

- [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) >= 3.0, <4.0

## Installing the extension üèó

You can install the extension using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-accessible-themes
```

If you prefer `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab-accessible-themes

# alternatively you can use mamba
mamba install jupyterlab-accessible-themes
```

After installing the extension, open JupyterLab, go to the top menu bar, go to Settings &gt; Theme, and choose one of the themes provided by this extension.

## Uninstalling the extension üßΩ

To remove the extension you can run the following command:

```bash
# if installed with pip
pip uninstall jupyterlab-accessible-themes

# if using conda
conda uninstall jupyterlab-accessible-themes
```

### Installing the development version üíª

#### Pre-requisites

1. You will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your local computer to build the extension package.
2. Python >= 3.8 and `pip`.

#### Building and linking the extension

> **Note**
> The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` in the commands below.

1. Clone this repository to your local computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes.git
   ```

2. Change to the `jupyterlab-accessible-themes` directory:

   ```bash
    cd jupyterlab-accessible-themes
   ```

3. Optional but recommended - Create and activate a development environment with conda:

   ```bash
   # Create environment named `jupyterlab-accessible-themes`
   conda create -n jupyterlab-accessible-themes
   conda activate jupyterlab-accessible-themes
   ```

4. Install JupyterLab and NodeJS **if not installed**:

   ```bash
   # Install node and jupyterlab from conda-forge
   conda install -c conda-forge 'nodejs>16' 'jupyterlab<4'
   ```

5. Install the node dependencies and build the extension:

   ```bash
   # Install node dependencies
   jlpm install

   # Compile packages before linking to Jupyterlab development version
   jlpm build
   ```

6. Install the package in development mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

7. Now you'll need to link the development version of the extension to JupyterLab and rebuild the Typescript source:

   ```bash
   # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
   jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
   ```

8. On the first installation, or after making some changes, to visualize them in your local JupyterLab re-run the following command:

   ```bash
   # Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
   jlpm build
   ```

9. Run JupyterLab and check that the installation worked:

```bash
# Run JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

> **Important**
> Once everything is installed, you will need to select the theme inside JupyterLab via the main menu `Settings > Theme`.

#### Further development tips

üîç You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory (JupyterLab accessible themes) in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
# Can use yarn or npm depending on your preference
jlpm watch

# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab instance.
Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools.
To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Pre-commit hooks üßπ

This repository uses the `prettier` [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) to standardize our YAML and markdown structure.

1. Before you can run the hooks, you need to install the pre-commit package manager:

   ```bash
   # using pip
   pip install pre-commit

   # if you prefer using conda
   conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
   ```

2. From the root of this project, install the git hook scripts:

   ```bash
   # install the pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Optional- run the hooks against the files in this repository

   ```bash
   # run the pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

### Uninstalling the development version üßΩ

1. Remove the extension:

   ```bash
   pip uninstall jupyterlab-accessible-themes
   ```

2. In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
   command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
   folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyterlab-accessible-themes` within that folder.

### Testing the extension ‚úÖ

#### Frontend tests

This extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.

To execute the tests run the following command:

```bash
jlpm
jlpm test
```

#### Integration tests

This extension uses [Playwright][playwright] for the integration tests (aka user-level tests).
More precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.
More information is provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.

### Packaging the extension üì¶

Detailed instructions for creating `jupyterlab-accesible-themes` can be found in the [RELEASE](RELEASE.md) file.
